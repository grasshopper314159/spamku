Child choked down with Nestle's Quick.
Choked up much more Quick.

Bite twice: it starts to entice
Bite thrice: paradise

Ah...the scrumptious gel!
SPAM, like a newborn
Muconium-like texture
Which do I love more?
Our first-born child does
Look a lot like a SPAM loaf.
Thank God it is not!
Never tasted SPAM
I don't think I ever will
I believe SPAMku
Broken tongued parrots
Chatter in lines of SPAMku
Again and again
Cheap eats SPAM once was.
Helped many a poor man out
Of the project slums.
The lost world of SPAM
Under the kitchen counter
Is covered with dark
When his time had come
That stalwart mister pig put
His shoulder in it
SPAM thou art my joy
But 'tis not thy taste I love
'Tis thy oozing fat
Vintage SPAM had cheese
To thicken up the stool-drool
And reduce "SPAM squirts."
Mating in the dark
SPAM cans Clunk! and bump ugly
Chasing off roaches.
Fall fireside dining
Browned Spamkabarfs on a stick
Sure beats the mission
Spamicidal gel
Use it to lube down your tube
Quiets the eel squeal
Found in the dumpster
A half eaten can of SPAM
Next to a dead rat
A SPAM in the hand
Is then worth two in the Bush
If your name is George.
SPAM can get crusty
If it hangs out overnight.
Put your SPAM away.
I used to love SPAM
Until my last pink pork binge
Now I'm withdrawing
I cough up pink phlegm
And little chunks of SPAM meat--
Spamatorium.
Labor'tory rats
Would rather eat SPAM than cheese
Post-lobotomy.
Allison my love
You're so much like a SPAM chunk,
Quiet, pink, and wet.
Christmas SPAM is ripe
Red and green colored yule logs
From the old privy
My SPAM is neither
Luncheon nor meat by golly,
It's food for the soul.
Spamalade jelly
It's great on crumpets with tea--
Drove Di up a wall.

Bite, chomp-chomp, *retch*, slurp Burp/Fartz!
Gawd! never again.
SPAM jingoism
Amazing grace of Hormel
I'm in total awe
Lard bellied Santa
Ate far too much reindeer SPAM
To fly this Christmas.
...amber lights scattered
across an urban surface
like glowing fireflies
My heart doth protest,
my veins, my veins, they harden,
yet, SPAM, thee I crave.
SPAM am some good stuff
It's Good in two ways......No good
And good for nothing.
"SPAM! Working class food."
"Stick to your drawers type food."
Bill Clinton said that.
New--SPAM Slices. Good
Idea! Folks who like it
Aren't safe with a knife...
Have your swill, your gruel
I prefer pink jellied treat
True SPAMecstasy.
O taste I detest
And parts of pig uncertain
Yet, SPAM I love thee
Now stop this madness!
Madness, yes, your obsession
With harmless Hormel.
SPAM fed our fathers
who fought bravely in the 'Nam.
Honor their effort.
Our dog-eat-dog world
demands some sacrifices.
Die or eat SPAM? Live!
I'd rather eat SPAM
than giggle in net chat rooms.
SPAM, at least, fulfills.
SPAM saves starving lives.
Makes a man think. Be a man!
Think spamku saves lives?
Tiresome, humorless
Instead of haiku on SPAM
More bad Clinton jokes
Seventy home-runs!
A can of SPAM every day,
That's how he did it!
Here we go again...
I thought I was over this
Spamku addiction.
Went a couple months
Without writing one Spamku
Then broke out in hives.
I am not quite sure
If the hives were from the loss,
Or from eating SPAM?
Pink meat in a can!
On the table every day,
When I'm home from school!
Went trick-or-treating.
The best treat that I received,
Was a can of SPAM.
Car was rusting out...
Till I patched the giant hole,
With a glob of SPAM!
White trash kids at school.
All they ever bring for lunch...
SPAM, SPAM, and more SPAM!
Of nuclear fusion.
Is it really possible?
Who cares? Let's eat SPAM!
Thanksgiving is soon!
Rhodes rolls and SPAM make great feast!
White trash meal of kings!
Time to go punch out!
Boy this day sure went by fast!
Writing SPAM Haikus!

SPAM seems strangely commonplace
As I wave goodbye.

wasting a morning.
Awash in SPAM dreams.
Pale sunlight softly touches
fresh barf on the floor.
Oink, oink, oink, oink, oink,
oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink!
Oink, oink, oink. Death. SPAM.
Licking wet pinkness,
engorged hot fervor juices.
Tongue cut on the can!
Mild-mannered tinned meat;
Look! Is it a bird? A pig?
No. It's SuperSPAM.
My powers wane; strange
Effects. Closest thing to Red
Kryptonite for man.
Grandma cooked us SPAM.
Grandpa ate it. We didn't.
His inheritance...
Linoleum grey.
Elsie's creamed SPAM casserole:
a porcine nightmare.
Cured pork shoulder, ground.
Cubed, skewered, hickory smoked.
Fools cower in fear.
Pork bellies are down,
Gelatin futures look bleak.
Heard it on C-SPAM.
SPAM is a force most
irresistable. My bowels,
most immovable.

You sent Spock, but I got SPAM!
Fix transporter soon."
I opened a can
Tiny evil pigs flapped out
Pandora's box lunch
Rudimentary
Circulation system is
Regenerating
Dreamed the other night
I was talking to the pigs
"Why us?" they wondered
Peering in the can
I could see the future clear
It looked rather pink
A fine meal until
The rest of the pig showed up
To reclaim his chunk.
Car is broken down.
I reach for the SPAM-er wrench.
Car is still broken.
I opened the door
Only to be confronted
By a wall of SPAM
The protesters marched
Holding their placards aloft
"We Demand Free SPAM"
Enormous SPAM slide
Hundreds of houses buried
The rescue dogs eat...
Tick, tock, the SPAM clock
Tells me when it's time to eat

Took advantage of the deal
Ate most of a tin

"Can You Feel The SPAM Tonight?"
SPAM roams the pride lands
Got in a SPAM fight.
Pink chunks streaking through the air.
Splat! Screams of disgust.
Tasty SPAM custard
Serve it to all of your friends
Laugh as they turn pale
In the darkened room
The SPAM cans whisper gently
Soft SPAM mutterings.
Teflon coated SPAM
More slippery than normal
And heat resistant
If Hormel branched out
With new meat types, we might see
Spicken, Spish, or Speef.
Playing with SPAM and
Genetic engineering
Strange horrors result.
As I yawned deeply
My friend jammed SPAM in my mouth
I force fed him can
One hot summer day
I found some SPAM in the street.
The smell? Amazing!
Try SPAM flavored beer,
And after you've drunk it all,
You can chew the bits.
All this SPAM haiku
If we keep writing so much
We'll run out of words
The SPAM tin grew hot
The metal began to bulge
I watched in horror
SPAM ear protection
Cram some SPAM into your ears
What was that you said?
Get your beauty sleep
On a bed made from fresh SPAM
Then--breakfast in bed!
Listen, good people
Deny ye not your SPAM love
Lest SPAM make you ill
Sit and meditate
Let thoughts of SPAM fill your mind.
And you will be...SPAM.
Once you've tasted SPAM
Your life is changed forever
Pity the addict
With chainsaw snarling
I lunged towards the SPAM cans
Must destroy evil!
Lunch, breakfast, dinner
All I ever eat is SPAM
I'm wasting away...
Don't ridicule me
I see nothing wrong with my
All-SPAM three piece suit
We beheld the SPAM
Its pink glory moved us all
We worshipped its form
My constant nightmare
Slowly sink in SPAM jelly
I wake up screaming
Do you suffer from
SPAMojellophobia?
Fear of SPAM jelly.
The mighty boat sank
Screaming people clung to SPAM
And the band played on
Good, dutiful SPAM
Lined up in supermarkets
Like well-trained soldiers
In the dead of night
Alien spacecraft steals pigs
Strange, alien SPAM
Custom SPAM colors
Any color you may want
As long as it's pink
A delicate bite
Leads to ravenous eating
SPAM bulimia
SPAM-seeking missile
I press the button marked "Launch"
Can is vaporized
Point gun at blue can
Another SPAM bites the dust
I laugh evilly
My silver SPAM knife
Cuts cleanly through the pink block
I eat SPAM with style
Visible from space
Biggest SPAM can in the world
50-year supply
In the Pyramid
Preserved for eternity
It's mummified SPAM
Anti-gravity
Extraterrestrial SPAM
Lands in my back yard
I stared in wonder,
Totally captivated--
The beauty of SPAM.
Furniture of SPAM
So you don't have to get up
To go for a snack
Ground breaks asunder
Satan claws his way from hell
He has come for SPAM
I lifted the axe
And with a sweeping motion
Executed SPAM
U.S. Air Force tests
Blasting SPAM at plane windshields
Should have opened can
Hot, these summer days
I bathe in cool SPAM jelly
My friends avoid me
I open the fridge
In the distance, a dog barks
A midnight SPAM feast
SPAM spawned a romance
Stared into her eyes, and shared--
One can, and two spoons
Activist cries out
"Give me SPAM or give me death"
The vultures oblige
The curtain was raised
The SPAM sat in the spotlight
And the tension grew
"What meaning has life?"
The SPAM rests, mute in the chair
Ignoring my angst
I finished my SPAM,
Then, stepping from the shadows,
Announced my presence.
The tourists visit
The leaning tower of SPAM
Now, eat from this side
They enjoyed the stew
But when offered SPAM ice cream
My dinner guests left.
Stopped at the airport
Customs searches my luggage
Lucky I hid SPAM
The storm clouds rolled in;
The winds roared around my house.
I smiled. I had SPAM.
SPAMity SPAM SPAM
Softly squishes 'neath my toes
In my mouth you goes
I saw the blue can
In the tinned products section
It captured my thoughts
Thoughts entered my dreams
The blue can--contents unknown
Cryptic label--SPAM
Three days passed slowly
Obsession overcame me
I must purchase SPAM
I lurked in the aisles
No one was looking at me
I reached for a tin
Cradling my new prize
I went to pay--disaster!
"Price check on large SPAM."
But nobody stared
I noticed them holding tins
Brotherhood of SPAM
Soon I arrived home,
Dimmed the lights, shut the curtains,
And prepared to feast.
I removed the key
Peeled back the metal layer
The fragrance hit me
I woke on the floor
Six hours of my life were gone
And so was the SPAM...
And sometimes at night
I lay awake, listening,
And I can hear it.
Clintonized pink meat:
Tender, loving, pleasuring--
Hillary take me!
I love Hillary
More than I love Hormel SPAM--
Do you think I'm odd?

But the pink SPAM clam.

As they turn to SPAM.

Looks like elephantine snot--
But it tastes like LOVE.
SPAM bites donkey, Dick.

If he ever was.

Issue was never good taste--
Not in Arkansas.
There's no beginning
And the end is not in sight--
The pain of SPAMku.
Jolly old England
Should be the home of pink SPAM--
It just smells that way.
SPAM sure is awful
But it's still legitimate--
Unlike Bubba Bill.
Ate SPAM at Joe's Grill
Stymied my body functions
And Clintoned my stool
Flagons of SPAM ick.
Sit on the bar awaiting
The Apocalypse.
Children of the SPAM
Walk ye the straight and narrow--
Supermarket aisles.
Following your nose
Will never lead you to SPAM
Unless you're a dog.

the wondeful SPAM
can be fun for many things
i love to eat SPAM
i remember you
the sliced slop-meat of childhood
you were my mother
I learned something new.
Pig parts can be quite tasty.
Figure that one out.
My god!  It's so pink!
You can't eat something this pink!
I wince at the thought!
a wise man's advice:
if the SPAM is not well sliced
you'd better flush twice
SPAM on the surface
Sinking through my inner ear
Reforge my soul now
Nineteen thousand SPAM-

Now you murder Foul.
OH!  Blue can, smelly
nightmare in my hand, blue can
how you scare me so!
Heart patient's nightmare
Enough salt to kill a horse
Slow death from Hormel
Poor dead turkey, canned
Why not make some veggie SPAM
Pigs and foul unite!
Feed ballot counters
nothing but SPAM until the
count is completed!
Foiled crime at market
Robber lays sprawled on the floor
Dented can nearby
Oh glutinous mass!
I obey your whispered pleas
To be digested
Backpacking heaven
Fry it over the campfire
Pork smell fills the woods
A broken jawbone
Puree a canful; Look ma,
no mastication!
History encased.
How many oinks were uttered
in this tiny can?
Hormel explosion
One can thrown higher than all
First SPAM satellite
You walked the earth once
Now, in the back of my fridge,
You will walk again
So hungry I am
That I desire any ham
Even in a can

Extravaganza!
9 am meeting.
Only five floaters showed up.
A soothing squealing.
Fid-eee card phone call:
mass confusion was normal.
SPAM mass less confused.
The One-Five-Five-Three
board has some components placed
like SPAM shotgun blast.
The blue can contents.
Repetitious excuses.

she crosses her legs
I can just see her pink thighs
SPAMish in their glow
lonely and depressed
i open a can of SPAM
to watch it quiver
a horrid faux-pas:
i serve cornbread and fried SPAM
but no mountain dew
she let herself go
and her pink belly mimicked
merry waves of SPAM
canned SPAM turns me on
it makes me so horny, i'm
screaming with delight

Sitting on toilet.
I deposit my SPAM waste.
Porcelain erupts.
Turned the key and saw

Salt in SPAM preserves.
Salt here falls in open wounds:
salty foaming snails.
The chief shaved his head,
something to do, change needed.
Pig snouts have more hair.
Speaking of more hair:
do those snouts get shaved before
the canning process??
Now that scary thought
will make me donate razors
to Mister Hormel.
Stiff toothbrush bristles.
Is there a market for this
pre-SPAM byproduct??
It's the next dot.com!!
Maybe Hormel already
has this idea.
On Thanksgiving Day,
most families eat turkey.
But our "bird" is SPAM.

A can sits untouched
